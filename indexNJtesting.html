        <h3> About me </h3>
        <p>
            I'm a 5th year computer science student at RIT. I currently work as an
            SLI for computer science for AP students. I have plenty of coding experience
            including Python, Java, C, and even MIPS Assembly. I took this class
            as I have no experience with web design and I thought it would be fun and
            beneficial to learn! I hope to keep these projects and this website around
            as an example of how little I knew about web design and (hopefully!) how far
            I've come by the end!

        <h3> Goals of website </h3>
        <p>
            Once I gain more web design experience I hope to host this on my own
            website (MichaelLah.com) and have it contain, much like this project,
            a professional section that I show to employers and a personal section
            they can also see.
